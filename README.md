# Paddock-Manager

## Motivation
This project is a study case in C. I want to learn and experiment some of the C capabilites to create a simple car racing manager. I will not provide the files to implement the races itself, all the project is meant to be open-source and I don't want to deal with trademark issues.
However i will try to build it flexible enought to possible to be able to run different categories with different specs.

## Thecnical Aspects
I wil keep the dependecies at the bare minimum, all the dependencies will be only for things I really can't or don't want to do. I might add a UI in the future, but for now I will focus on the internal engine first.
