# Paddock-Manager

## Motivation
This project is a study case in C. I want to learn and experiment with some of the C capabilities to create a simple car racing manager. I will not provide the data files to implement the races; the project is meant to be open-source, and I don't want to deal with trademark issues.
My goal is to build a car racing manager that's not only simple but also adaptable. We're designing it to be flexible enough to run different categories with different specs, ensuring it can meet a variety of needs.

## Technical Aspects
The project, Paddock-Manager, will keep dependencies at a bare minimum, with additional dependencies only for tasks that are either impossible or impractical to implement. While a UI might be added in the future, the initial focus will be on the internal engine of the project.

## Dependencies
- SQLite3 (Almagamation Version)
- Unity (For Unitary Testing)

## Missing Features
### MPV - Full Race with AI Runners
- [] Read driver data from a sqlite3 table.
- [] Read racing tyre data from a sqlite3 table.
- [] Make the driver's skills influence the lap timing.
- [] Create random opponents for the race and implement a simple AI.
